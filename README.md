# Socket Programming 
This repository contains multiple network interface applications that are built by Socket Programming in Python from Scratch.

The respected code files are allocated into directories for easy access and running.

Refer to **Project Description.pdf** to understand the problem statements the Project solves.

Refer to **Project Report.pdf** to understand the detailed implementation of the project with the codes and necessary live deployed project screenshots.

Refer to the **ReadMe** files present inside the directories to run each particular socket programming application.

#### Screenshots of the Live Project Deployment have also been attached for a comprehensive analysis of the solution.

Refer to **requirements.txt** to install the necessary Python Library requirements

# Socket Programming Project

## Part 1: UDP Echo Client and Server

### Goal
Create your own UDP echo client and server application to measure round-trip time between the client and server, similar to the "ping" command.

### Task 1
1. Create a UDP echo client that sends echo packets to the server at a given interval, number of echo messages, and packet size (use command line arguments).
2. Upon receiving a packet, the server should send it back to the client.
3. The client should calculate and display the round-trip time. You can use timestamps or unique identifiers in the packets for this purpose.
4. Calculate and print the loss percentage at the end.

### Task 2
1. Create an iperf-like application using the UDP echo client and server developed in Task 1.
2. Reduce the interval between two consecutive UDP echo packets generated by the client to increase the number of echo packets sent for a given packet size.
3. Calculate the throughput and average delay observed every one second.
4. Plot the observed throughput and average delay vs. time (1-second intervals).

## Part 2: Extend Echo Client/Server

### Goal
Add any two new features to the Echo Client/Server and describe their benefits in the report.

## Part 3: Communication Between Two Computers

### Goal
Choose one of the following modes:
- **EASY Mode:** Implement 1 server and 1 client. Extend the server program to accept typing on the server itself without echoing.
- **NORMAL Mode:** Implement 1 server and 2 clients. Extend the server program to forward a message from client 1 to client 2. You may skip management of client IDs.
- **HARD Mode:** Implement 1 server and N clients. Allow N clients to connect to the server. Design a system where Client 1 can communicate with any other client (Client m). Explain how you manage multiple clients and select the one you want to talk to in your report.

## Part 4: Protocol Independence

### Goal
Revise the echo client and server to be protocol-independent, supporting both IPv4 and IPv6. Here are some hints:
1. Use `sockaddr_storage` to handle both `sockaddr_in` and `sockaddr_in6`.
2. Integrate `getaddrinfo` to avoid specifying IPv6 addresses on the command line.
3. You may use hostnames like "localhost" for IPv4 and "ip6-localhost" for IPv6 to develop and demonstrate the software on Ubuntu. These hostnames are defined in "/etc/hosts."

*Note: Ensure that you provide detailed documentation and explanations in your report for each part of the project, including code snippets, diagrams, and any challenges you faced during development.*
